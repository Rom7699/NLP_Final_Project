# NLP_Final_Project
This project aims to automatically cluster user requests based on their semantic meaning, select representative requests from each cluster, and generate meaningful labels for each cluster. The project employs various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including embedding, clustering, and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.
